# Dissertation

This code was built on the R package "mlDNA" to identify sucrose-responsive genes in A.thaliana using a Positive Sample Only Learning Algorithm with Machine Learning models. The Dissertation_datasets folder contains the normalised datasets of a lateral root initiation in response to auxin microarray dataset from the paper "Cell cycle progression in the pericycle is not sufficient for SOLITARY ROOT/IAA14-mediated lateral root initiation in Arabidopsis thaliana" and a response to sucrose addition in whole root RNA-seq dataset from the paper "CEPâ€“CEPR1 signalling inhibits the sucrose-dependent enhancement of lateral root growth". The PSOL-ML code is available in the RMD file.
